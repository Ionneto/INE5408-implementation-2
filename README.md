# INE5408-implementation-2

How it's going to work:

We first run trough every single man page and create two trees:
  -  The first tree is of nameContent structs, those are structs made of a name and a content, we can search those
    by name later and print the contents.
   - The second tree is going to be made of wordName structs, those are gonna be searchable by word, and going to
    relate a word you look for with every single man page that has this word in it.


Checkpoints:
    Being able to create nameContent Tree: OK
    Being able to create wordName Tree:
    Being able to search the nameContent Tree:
    Being able to search the wordName Tree:
    Being able to use 2 words to make search the wordName Tree:
